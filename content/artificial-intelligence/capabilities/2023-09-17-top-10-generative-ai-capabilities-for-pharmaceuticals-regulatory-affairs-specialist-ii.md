7. Extraction and Reformatting: Leverage extraction and reformatting capabilities to automatically extract relevant information from large datasets, such as clinical trial data or safety data sheets. This can help reduce manual effort and improve the accuracy of your analysis.
8. Code Generation: Use code generation capabilities to automate routine coding tasks, such as data cleaning and formatting, or even entire software development projects. This can save time and effort and enable more rapid prototyping and development.
9. Search: Take advantage of search capabilities to quickly locate relevant regulatory information, such as agency guidelines or clinical trial results. This can help you stay up-to-date with the latest regulatory developments and make more informed decisions.
10. Synthesizing: Use synthesizing capabilities to combine different types of regulatory data, such as clinical trial results and safety data, to generate new insights and perspectives. This can help identify novel regulatory strategies and approaches that can differentiate your organization from competitors.
