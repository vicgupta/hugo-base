7. Extraction and Reformatting: Automatically extract relevant information from vendor contracts, shipping documents, and other business-related papers. By reformat this information into structured formats, the AI model can save me time and reduce errors, allowing me to focus on high-value tasks.
8. Code Generation: Assist in generating code snippets and templates for inventory management software, order tracking systems, and other operational tools. By analyzing existing codebases and learning programming patterns, the AI model can generate code that aligns with our coding standards and development best practices.
9. Search: Enhance search functionality by analyzing images, videos, audio files, and text related to sporting goods. By processing these media types and extracting relevant information, the AI model can provide faster and more accurate search results, improving the overall shopping experience.
