4. Planning and Scheduling: Leverage planning and scheduling capabilities to optimize resource allocation and manage projects more efficiently.

6. Personalization: Create personalized experiences for clients by analyzing their preferences and behavior. Use generative AI models to generate customized content, recommendations, or interfaces tailored to individual users. This can significantly enhance engagement and satisfaction levels, leading to increased loyalty and retention.
7. Extraction and Reformatting: Automate the extraction of relevant information from unstructured data sources, such as documents, images, or videos. Then, reformatted this data into structured formats, making it easier for clients to access and understand. This capability can save time and improve collaboration between you and your clients.
8. Code Generation: Assist software development efforts by generating code snippets, templates, or entire programs. These models can learn programming patterns and create code that aligns with specific requirements and coding standards. This can help streamline development processes and ensure consistent coding practices across projects.

This can enable more accurate searching and retrieval of relevant information, helping clients find what they need quickly and efficiently. As a graphic designer, you may not directly benefit from this capability, but it can enhance the overall user experience for your clients' websites or applications.
10. Synthesizing: Combine existing elements in creative ways to generate new content.
